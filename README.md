# Master_Thesis

This github page contains the files that were created and used for the Master Thesis research project. It contains the Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) model, python notebook scripts and the gathered simulation data. The goal of the model is to simulate the supply chain processes and interactions between relevant agents of the bicycle distribution among the military bases of the Ministry of Defence of the Netherlands. The scientific aspect that this research has aimed to fill is to better understand intra-organisational supply chains using the novel Agent-Based Modelling method and the Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) workbench package.

The conclusions drawn from the ABM model results can be read in the Master Thesis, which is also included on this page. The master thesis can be found at the TUDelft repository as well.

## Important:
Running the Python notebook code requires the dataset which is downloadable via the following google drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u7LCjIJUlyGcK5XmhWo8AKRZ05VFQBd6/view?usp=sharing

Running the ABM model requires NetLogo 6.2.0 program which is downloadable at https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml. The kaartvnl.png file required for initializing the model.

The research was executed in collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Defence.
